## Repository status
This repository was originally hosted privately elsewhere, and certain sensitive information was hardcoded. The history is therefore gone.

## Swagger documentation
Documentation of the API can always be viewed while the project is running at ``HOST:PORT/DOCS``. A live example is hosted at ``https://gcpapi.cxdur.xyz/internal/docs/``.

## Testing locally
Install dependencies by using ``npm install`` and then run ``npm run start``. The server should automatically restart as changes are applied.

## Running in production
Install dependencies by using ``npm install`` and then run ``npm run prod``.

## Running tests
Make sure dependencies are installed, and run tests by using ``npm test``.
